# Crazy-Construct
Made by George Li and Sasha Barazandeh
A short game created by me and my friend for our grade 12 comp sci class, inspired by the flash game "Bad Ice Cream".

 * Consists of multiple levels, each level getting progressively harder
 * Pick up all the coins to advance but avoid getting hit by the enemy ghost
 * Can build a row of walls in the direction of the player to stall, the enemies
 * Use arrow keys to move and space to 
 * Even though he's a ghost he can't move through walls lol
